# HTMX Modal Popup Example

## What This Is

This repo is a straight-to-the-point demonstration of a modal popup using HTMX. Why? Because sometimes the best way to make a point is to just show it.

## The Files

- **index.html:** Your usual webpage with a button. Nothing fancy.
- **registration.html:** A popup form. Still, no JavaScript in sight.
- **button.html:** A button to close the popup. Again, no JavaScript.

## How It Works

We're using HTMX here. Click the button on the main page, and voilà, a modal popup appears without a single line of JavaScript. Close it, open it — all smooth, all HTMX.

## Live Demo

If you want to see it in action without cloning and running it yourself, here's the link: [https://yarlson.github.io/htmx-example/](https://yarlson.github.io/htmx-example/).

## A Note on HTMX

HTMX? It's just HTML on steroids. No need to wrestle with npm, Webpack, or 15 levels of dependencies just to make a button do something on a webpage.
